# high-speed-pong
I started a small Pong project for fun and I ended up coding a high speed collision system...

With a simple system (translation with speed vector) the ball can easily pass through the bars at high speed, so I calculated ball's next position depending on its speed, direction and the objects on its path. no the ball can have a huge speed. Then I had fun with my line collision system...
