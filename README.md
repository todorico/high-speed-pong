# high-speed-pong
I started a small Pong project for fun and I ended up coding a high speed collision system...

With a simple system (translation with speed vector) the ball can easily pass through objects (the bars) at high speed, so I calculated ball's next position depending on its direction, speed and by tracing rays on ball's path. With this technique the ball can have a huge speed without passing through objects. Then I had fun with my line collision system...
